I'm Ava, your personal crm bot.
I can help you remember birthdays, set reminders and keep a general log of your day.
To start with, Here's are a few entries from the day log / journal feature:
* Journaling with tags *
`
.al today I learnt about mastery learning. 
.ac called up Joseph from school. Its been ages!
.aw slow, productive, introspective
.ag I am grateful for the rains. I love the rains.  

`
Simply precede your text with the `.ax` tag and it gets stored with that id.
The fun part is that you can download and analyse all your enties at end of the week!
For a full list of all tags click here  https://telegra.ph/Ava-Bot-06-04

* Set Reminders *
`ava remind me to call boss tomorrow at 9am`
`/r pick up the trash next friday at noon`
`/r pay the bills 3 days from now`
Either of these tags work. Also, I can read time in natural language!

* Shorten urls *
`ava shorten https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0`
I instantly replies with `Here's the shortened url: https://is.gd/2aLkKB`

*Summarize Long Articles*
`ava summary https://www.economist.com/the-boundary-between-crypto-and-fiat`
